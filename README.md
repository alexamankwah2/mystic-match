# Mystic Match
Welcome to the React memory game with a turn count! This is a classic memory-testing game built using React, where players are challenged to match pairs of cards in the fewest turns possible. The game keeps track of the number of turns taken to complete the game, adding an extra layer of challenge.

## Rules
* Click on a card to reveal its hidden symbol.
* Click on another card to find its matching symbol.
* If the symbols match, the cards stay face up.
* If the symbols don't match, both cards will be flipped face down again.
* The goal is to match all pairs of cards with the fewest possible moves.

## Features
* Responsive design, suitable for various screen sizes.
* Randomized card positions for a new challenge each time.
* Moves counter to keep track of the number of card flips.

## Technologies used
* React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* CSS: Styling the components and layout.
* React-Router: Handling navigation and routing within the app.
* State Management: Utilizing React Hooks for managing game state.
